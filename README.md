# Smart Waste Management System

## Overview
A real-time IoT-enabled system developed to monitor and optimize waste collection using **ultrasonic sensors**, **NodeMCU**, and **cloud analytics**.  
The project aims to automate waste level monitoring, reduce manual collection delays, and ensure efficient waste segregation for sustainable urban management.

## Features
- Real-time waste bin monitoring using **ultrasonic sensors**  
- Automatic alerts when bin levels exceed a set threshold  
- Data logging and visualization using **ThingSpeak / Firebase**  
- Route optimization potential for municipal waste collection  
- Low-cost, scalable, and energy-efficient IoT design
